This tells Azure to create the storage account before it creates the web app.\nlet myWebApp = webApp {\r...\rdepends_on myStorage\r}\rAdding the storage account to the deployment Add the storage account to the deployment using the same add_resource keyword as you did with myWebApp.\nAnalysing the ARM template Run the application; you should notice that the template now contains a storage account.

	"content": "How can I help? Try out Farmer and see what you think.\n Create as many issues as you can for both bugs, discussions and features Create suggestions for features and the most important elements you would like to see added  I have an Azure subscription, but I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert. I like the look of this - how do I \u0026ldquo;use\u0026rdquo; it?  Create an ARM template using the Farmer sample app. Follow the steps here to deploy the generated template into Azure. Log any issues or ideas that you find here.  I don\u0026rsquo;t know F#. Would you consider writing a C# version of this? I\u0026rsquo;m afraid not. F# isn\u0026rsquo;t hard to learn (especially for simple DSLs such as this), and you can easily integrate F# applications as part of a dotnet solution, since F# is a first-class citizen of the dotnet core ecosystem.\nAre you trying to replace ARM templates? No, we\u0026rsquo;re not. Farmer generates ARM templates that can be used just as normal; Farmer can be used simply to make the process of getting started much simpler, or incorporated into your build pipeline as a way to avoid managing difficult-to-manage ARM templates and instead use them as the final part of your build / release pipeline.\nAre you trying to compete with Pulumi? No, we\u0026rsquo;re not. Farmer has (at least currently) a specific goal in mind, which is to lower the barrier to entry for creating and working with ARM templates that are non-complex. We\u0026rsquo;re not looking to create a cross-platform DSL to also support things like Terraform etc. or support deployment of code along with infrastructure (or, at least, only to the extent that ARM templates do).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no support for variables or parameters! Farmer does support securestring parameters for e.g. SQL and Virtual Machine passwords - these are automatically generated based on the contents of the template rather than explicitly by yourself. However, we don\u0026rsquo;t currently plan on providing rich support for either parameters or variables for several reasons:\n We want to keep the Farmer codebase simple for maintainers We want to keep the Farmer API simple for users We want to keep the generated ARM templates as readable as possible We feel that instead of trying to embed conditional logic and program flow directly inside ARM templates in JSON, if you wish to parameterise your template that you should use a real programming language to do that: in this case, F#.
